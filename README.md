### On forking this repo

If you want/need to fork this repository remember to add the [AEM Code Sync GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync) to the fork repository. Also please be sure to name the repo `exlm` for consistency.

### Content Source

The default content source is set in `fstab.yaml`, by default it's pointing to the main [exlm-converter](https://github.com/adobe-experience-league/exlm-converter) action.

The action is the entry point for all HTML delivered to https://aem.live services.

> while developing, and if you need to update the source HTML, you are free to deploy [exlm-converter](https://github.com/adobe-experience-league/exlm-converter) action to your own project on Adobe Runtime. (Remember to point your forked repon `fstab.yaml` to your own action).

## Helpful Commands

| Command           | Usage                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `npm run up`      | Run SASS compilation and `aem up`      |
| `npm run quality` | Code quality check: format and linting |
| `npm run format`  | Format code                            |
| `npm run lint`    | Run JS/SASS linters                    |

### Note on SASS usage and Helix Local Development

The `npm run up` will parse the `styles` and `blocks` directory for any `.scss` files. Files that are found will be compiled to css and saved in the same location and name with a `.css` extension. It will then continue to watch for changes to `.scss` files and will compile to their associated CSS files on changes.

Examples:

- `{repo}/blocks/header/header.scss` will compile to `{repo}/blocks/header/header.css`
- `{repo}/styles/style.scss` will compile to `{repo}/styles/styles.css`

As both `sass-compile.js` and `hlx up` are watching for changes, changes made to your sass files while using the `rpm run up` command will be reflected automatically in your localhost.

Note that using only the `hlx up` command will not trigger updates on-change for sass files.

## Local SignedIn Development

Use this only if you need sign-in to work locally for development purposes.

1. add this entry to `hosts` file (`/etc/hosts` on mac)
   `127.0.0.1 experienceleague-local.adobe.com`
   (you likely will need `sudo` to save this file)
2. run `npm run up-secure` (instead of `npm run up`)
   > you can use `npm run up-secure-prod` if you want to use production content.
3. Browser should automatically open at `https://experienceleague-local.adobe.com`
   > if asked to trust the certificate on the browser, do trust it. Might also need to allow runnig as admin (`sudo`)

> If you have a Windows machine, please add any learnings to this Doc. The current dev team uses MacOs.
